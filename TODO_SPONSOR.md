s# FORGE-OS Sponsor Page Plan

## Information Gathered:
1. **Project**: FORGE-OS - a Kaspa-native quant trading control plane
2. **Current Issue**: GitHub Sponsor page link returns 404
3. **Goal**: Create a working sponsor page that links to the Kaspa address
4. **Kaspa Address**: `kaspa:qpv7fcvdlz6th4hqjtm9qkkms2dw0raem963x3hm8glu3kjgj7922vy69hv85`
5. **Deployment**: GitHub Pages at forge-os.xyz

## Plan:

### Step 1: Create SPONSOR.md file at repo root
- Create a nicely designed sponsor page markdown file
- Include the Kaspa donation address prominently
- Add instructions on how to donate
- Style it with badges and clear CTAs

### Step 2: Create docs/SPONSOR.md for documentation
- Mirror the sponsor content in the docs folder for completeness

### Follow-up Steps:
- The user will need to add the sponsor link to their GitHub repo settings
- The SPONSOR.md file will show when someone clicks on the Sponsor button if configured

## Dependent Files:
- None (creating new files)

## Implementation Notes:
- GitHub looks for `SPONSOR.md` at the root or in `.github/` folder
- This file appears on the sponsor button/profile when configured
- The page should be visually appealing with clear instructions
